RAG Fusion - Retrieval Augmented Generation with Fusion-in-Decoder
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Fusion-in-Decoder, an advanced NLP technique that enhances language generation by fusing retrieved documents directly into the decoder. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers and DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval) models to retrieve relevant contexts and generate high-quality, grounded responses.

🎯 Objectives
Combine retrieval and generation for improved question answering

Implement the Fusion-in-Decoder mechanism for answer synthesis

Experiment with multiple retriever outputs to enhance context

Enable robust, accurate, and relevant responses using RAG

📁 Project Structure
RAG_fusion.ipynb: Main notebook demonstrating the full workflow

README.md: Project documentation

requirements.txt: Required dependencies (if exporting to a repo or packaging)

🔧 Features
Uses Hugging Face's RagTokenForGeneration model

Performs semantic retrieval using DPRQuestionEncoder and DPRContextEncoder

Combines multiple passages with Fusion-in-Decoder

Generates responses grounded in retrieved documents

🚀 Tech Stack
Python

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

FAISS (for similarity search)

Google Colab (for GPU acceleration)

🛠️ How It Works
Input Query: User provides a natural language question.

Dense Retrieval: DPR retrieves top relevant passages from a document index using FAISS.

Fusion-in-Decoder: The RAG model fuses the encoded documents directly into the decoder.

Answer Generation: Generates a context-aware response grounded in retrieved passages.

🧪 Sample Use Case
python
Copy
Edit
query = "What is the capital of France?"
response = rag_fusion_pipeline(query)
print(response)
Output:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"Paris is the capital and most populous city of France."
📌 Key Benefits
More accurate and grounded answers

Scalable retrieval over large corpora

Better performance on open-domain QA tasks

🧠 Future Enhancements
Custom knowledge base integration

UI for interactive chat experience

Evaluate with benchmarks like Natural Questions or WebQuestions
